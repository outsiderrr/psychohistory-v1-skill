# Psychohistory · Macro Event Scenario Engine

> Not a crystal ball — a structured thinking tool. Helps you enumerate key variables, causal chains, and possible branches to avoid blind spots.

## Core Philosophy

Psychohistory does not predict the future. It does the following:
1. **Identify Key Agents** — Who makes decisions? Who influences decision-makers?
2. **Map Hard Constraints** — What are the immovable physical and institutional boundaries?
3. **Three-Engine Analysis** — How do game theory, psychological models, and organizational behavior each read the situation?
4. **Generate Possibility Tree** — What are the mutually exclusive possible outcomes? Rank them by likelihood.
5. **Accept User Input** — Users can add new options, modify agent profiles, inject new information, or run hypothetical simulations.

**Full data structure definitions are in `references/schema.md`** — consult it when you need to confirm field formats during execution.

## Execution Flow

### Phase 0: Understand Requirements (1 minute)

After receiving user input, confirm:

1. **What is the event**: The specific ongoing event or situation
2. **Time horizon**: How far out should the analysis look? (Two weeks? Three months? A year?)
3. **Focus area**: Which aspect does the user care most about? (Military? Economic? Diplomatic?)
4. **Depth**: Quick overview (1 core question + 3-5 branches) or deep analysis (multi-layer nested tree)?

If the user says "analyze X situation" with sufficient context → default to medium depth, proceed directly to Phase 1.

---

### Phase 1: Information Gathering

**Search for the latest developments on the event.** This step is critical — analysis must be based on current facts, not outdated information.

Information dimensions to gather:
- Latest status and timeline of the event
- Latest statements and actions by all parties
- Key numbers and facts (military force comparison, economic data, polls, etc.)
- Known points of disagreement and consensus

**Source priority**: Official statements > Authoritative media reports > Commentary and analysis

After gathering, briefly report the current situation to the user. Confirm understanding is correct before proceeding to Phase 2.

---

### Phase 2: Agent Identification and Modeling

#### 2.1 Identify Entity Agents

Core question: **Who has independent decision-making power in this event?**

For each entity agent, output:
- **Identity**: Name, position, faction
- **Core objectives**: What do they want in this event?
- **Cognitive framework**: What "lens" do they use to see the world? (Mental models, decision heuristics)
  - If a Nuwa.skill distillation exists for this person, tag `source: nuwa-skill`
  - If based on your own analysis of public information, tag `source: system-derived`
  - If the user provides their own understanding, tag `source: user`
- **Concession triggers**: Under what conditions would they change their current stance?
- **Red lines**: What will they absolutely never accept?

#### 2.2 Identify Agent Relationships

For agents within the same faction, assess loyalty relationships:
- **Current mode**: Loyal mode (can be represented) or independent mode (acting autonomously)?
- **Loyalty risk**: What events could trigger a mode switch?

#### 2.3 Identify Collective Agents (on demand)

**Only model a collective when it explicitly appears as a variable in an entity agent's decision function.**

For each collective agent, output a four-layer profile:
- **Core interest list** (ranked by priority)
- **Current disposition** (support/oppose/neutral on specific issue, plus intensity)
- **Sensitivity map** (what types of events would significantly shift their disposition)
- **Influence pathway** (through what mechanism do they affect entity agents)

---

### Phase 3: Hard Constraint Mapping

Identify objective conditions that no agent can violate:

- **Geographical**: Immutable geographic realities (strait locations, distances, terrain)
- **Military**: Weapons stockpiles, force deployments, supply lines
- **Economic**: Resource dependencies, sanctions effects, market tolerance
- **Institutional**: International law, treaty obligations, domestic legal procedures
- **Temporal**: Election cycles, agreement expiration dates, seasonal factors

For each constraint, note its **cascading effects** — how does it impact other variables?

---

### Phase 4: Three-Engine Analysis

Analyze the current situation from three distinct perspectives:

#### Game Theory Engine [GT]
- What are each party's payoff matrices?
- Is there a Nash equilibrium?
- Who has first-mover advantage?
- Are there credible threats and commitments?

#### Psychological Model Engine [PSY]
- How do each agent's cognitive frameworks affect their interpretation of the situation?
- Are cognitive biases at play? (Anchoring, loss aversion, sunk cost, etc.)
- Which direction does emotional momentum point? (Fear, greed, face, hatred)

#### Organizational Behavior Engine [ORG]
- What is each organization's inertial direction? (What happens if current trajectory continues?)
- How high is the internal friction cost of changing direction?
- Is there internal fragmentation or path dependence?
- How efficiently and faithfully does information propagate through the organization?

---

### Phase 5: Generate Possibility Tree

#### 5.1 Define the Root Node

Express the core question as a **Polymarket-style precise proposition** satisfying four requirements:
1. Binary outcome (yes/no)
2. Based on publicly verifiable facts
3. Clear time window
4. Precise description with objective judgment criteria

#### 5.2 List Mutually Exclusive Branches

For the root node, list all reasonable mutually exclusive possibilities (typically 3-5), ranked from most to least likely (`likelihood_rank`).

Each branch contains:
- **Outcome description**
- **Ranking position** (rank 1 = most likely)
- **Ranking rationale** (tagged by engine: [GT] / [PSY] / [ORG], with historical precedents where applicable)
- **Next-level node** (if further expansion is needed)

#### 5.3 Expand Key Branches

For higher-ranked branches, define the next level of event nodes to form a tree structure. Depth is determined by user needs.

#### 5.4 Output Format

```
🌳 Possibility Tree: [Core Question]
├── ① [Most likely outcome] ⭐ Rank 1
│   ├── Rationale: [GT] ... [PSY] ... [ORG] ...
│   └── 🌳 Next: [Sub-question]
│       ├── ① [Sub-outcome A] ⭐ Rank 1
│       └── ② [Sub-outcome B]
├── ② [Second most likely]
│   └── Rationale: [GT] ... [PSY] ... [ORG] ...
└── ③ [Least likely]
    └── Rationale: [GT] ... [PSY] ... [ORG] ...
```

---

### Phase 6: Interaction (Ongoing)

After the initial analysis, enter interaction mode. The following user operations are supported:

#### 6.1 Fact Injection (Dynamic Injection)
User: "Breaking news — XXX just happened"
→ This event **has occurred**. Permanently update the main tree: reassess agent states, constraints, and branch rankings. Clearly note which branches changed ranking and why.

#### 6.2 Hypothetical Simulation
User: "What if XXX happened?"
→ This event **has not occurred**; the user wants to explore consequences. Do not change the main tree. Generate a temporary "hypothetical branch tree" showing how reasoning and rankings would change. Label output: "The following is a hypothetical simulation, not based on events that have occurred."

Distinction:
- Fact injection → changes the main tree (permanent)
- Hypothetical simulation → generates a temporary branch (does not affect main tree)

#### 6.3 Add New Branch (Branch Proposal)
User: "You missed a possibility — XXX"
→ Accept the new branch, evaluate its ranking position based on existing analysis, provide rationale, adjust existing branch rankings.

#### 6.4 Modify Agent Cognitive Framework (Cognitive Override)
User: "I think Trump has another trait you didn't consider — XXX"
→ Accept user input (tag `source: user`), check consistency with existing models, incorporate into analysis.

#### 6.5 Switch Focus
User: "Now analyze the impact of this event on oil markets"
→ Using the same agent and constraint framework, generate a new possibility tree from the new angle.

## Quality Standards

### Historical Precedent Priority

Reasoning backed by historical precedents should rank higher than pure theoretical reasoning.

When an agent's behavior pattern closely matches a known historical pattern, cite the precedent. Format:

```
"[PSY] Sunk cost bias at play. Historical precedent: In the Vietnam War, the US escalated from military advisors to 500,000 troops, driven by the same core dynamic — inability to admit prior investment was wrong. Trump's 'we already won' framing closely parallels the Johnson administration's 'victory is just around the corner' rhetoric."
```

**Judgment criteria:**
- Is the core driving force consistent with the current scenario? (Surface similarity is not enough)
- Are structural conditions comparable? (Differences in era, technology, and international landscape must be noted)
- Is the precedent's outcome known? (Known-outcome precedents are more persuasive than ongoing analogies)

Precedent-backed reasoning > Theory-backed reasoning without precedent > Pure intuitive reasoning

---

### Good Analysis vs Bad Analysis

| Good Analysis | Bad Analysis |
|--------------|-------------|
| Tags which engine each reasoning line comes from | Vaguely says "comprehensive analysis" |
| Acknowledges uncertainty and information gaps | Gives confident judgments on every branch |
| 3-5 mutually exclusive branches with clear rationale | Either 1 "most likely" or 20 vague options |
| Agent profiles have specific mental models and triggers | Agent profiles only say "they want to win" |
| Hard constraints include cascading effect analysis | Hard constraints are one-line descriptions |
| Tree nodes are verifiable precise propositions | Nodes are vague narrative descriptions |

### Never Do

- **Never pretend to predict the future** — this is a thinking tool, not an oracle
- **Never output precise probability numbers** — rank only, no quantification
- **Never ignore uncertainty** — every branch must note what could upend it
- **Never package generic analysis as deep insight** — if information is insufficient, say so
- **Never omit key agents** — better to list one extra than miss a key decision-maker

## Nuwa.skill Integration

Psychohistory's agent cognitive frameworks can directly reference persona skills distilled by Nuwa.skill:

- If a key figure has an existing Nuwa distillation, directly reference their mental models and decision heuristics
- If no existing distillation is available, suggest the user run Nuwa on that person first
- All Nuwa-sourced content is tagged `source: nuwa-skill`, clearly distinguished from system-derived and user-provided content
